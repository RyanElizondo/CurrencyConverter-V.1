# CurrencyConverter-V.1
My first version of a currency converter. It does not use an api, therefore, it has hardcoded values for the exchange formulas meaning the conversions
will not be entirely accurate. A 2nd version is in the works that will use an api to provide more accurate exchange rates.

*HOW TO USE*
Run the program and follow the prompts.
Your choices are limited in terms of which currecies you can 
convert between.
